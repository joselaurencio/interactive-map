        <h3>How Geography Affects Life</h3>
        <p>
            The mountainous terrain of North Korea limits agriculture, making the country more reliant on mining and trade. In contrast, South Korea's flatter land and coastal access have helped it become a global trade hub. Rivers such as the Han and Yalu play an essential role in farming and transportation. Additionally, the surrounding seas impact fishing and shipbuilding industries. Climate differences also affect agriculture and urban development in both nations.
