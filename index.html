    <h2>Geography and Its Impact</h2>
    <p>
      The physical geography of North and South Korea plays a major role in daily life. 
      Mountainous terrain, such as the Taebaek Mountains, limits farmland in parts of North Korea, while South Korea’s flatter regions near its rivers promote agriculture and urban development. 
      Rivers like the Han and Yalu are vital for trade and transport. 
      Coastal access boosts fishing and global trade, and natural boundaries also affect defense strategies.
