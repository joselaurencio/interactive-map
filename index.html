    <h2>Geography and Its Impact</h2>
    <p>
      The physical geography of North and South Korea plays a major role in how people live. 
      Mountainous terrain in North Korea limits farmland, while South Korea’s flatter land near rivers supports agriculture and cities. 
      Rivers like the Han and Yalu are crucial for trade and transport. Coastal access helps with fishing and global trade. 
      Natural barriers like mountains also influence defense and communication.
